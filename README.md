Story so far:

Run motor.m to initialise the connection and the motors.

Run motor_const.m to get the gear ratios.

Make sure motor_forward and motor_backward are in your working directory.

Now you can control the motors! The left pane in MATLAB (with the variables) will describe the motors and gear ratios. You use the functions like this:

motor_forward(motorname, motorgearratio, angle);

For example:

motor_forward(mA, mA_GR, 45);

That's it!
